The Student Performance Analyzer is a C program that helps analyze the marks of multiple students. It takes the marks of up to 10 students as input, calculates the average, highest, and lowest marks, and then determines how many students passed or failed.
Using conditional statements, the program assigns each student a grade based on their score:
A+ (90 and above)
A (80–89)
B (70–79)
C (60–69)
D (50–59)
Fail (below 50)
It then displays a detailed summary showing the average marks, total passes and fails, and grade distribution.
This project demonstrates key C concepts like:
Arrays (to store marks)
Loops (for input and processing)
Conditional logic (for grading and evaluation)
Formatted output
In short, it’s a beginner-friendly C program that automates student result analysis efficiently and clearly.
