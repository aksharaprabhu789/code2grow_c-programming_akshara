This program analyzes attendance and academic performance of 5 students across 5 subjects. 
It uses only 2D arrays and loops, strictly following the constraints (no functions, no pointers, no structures).
The system stores student names, attendance (1/0), and marks for all subjects.
It displays an interactive menu using a loop + switch–case.
Option 1 displays the complete attendance matrix.
Option 2 displays the marks matrix subject-wise.
The attendance report shows total present/absent count for each student. 
It also identifies the highest and lowest attendance among all students.
The performance report calculates total and average marks.
It identifies the class topper and lowest performer.
The grade report assigns grades (A+ to F) based on average marks.
The menu continues running until the user selects Exit (6).
