1. This program simulates a Smart City Traffic Monitoring System for up to 30 vehicles.
2. It stores vehicle ID, speed, and lane values using 1D arrays.
3. Speed violations are detected based on the 80 km/h limit.
4. The program also finds the highest and lowest speeds recorded.
5. Lane violations are detected using a rule based on VehicleID % 4.
6. Vehicles not in their expected lane are marked as lane violators.
7. Severity of lane violation is measured using the absolute lane difference.
8. Traffic density per lane is counted to find the busiest and least busy lanes.
9. A complete traffic report table is displayed with all violation details.
10. Finally, the system prints summary statistics for speed, lane, and traffic density.
